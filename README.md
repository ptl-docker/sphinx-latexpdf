sphinx-doc plus texlive

NOTE: There is also an official sphinx-latexpdf docker: `sphinxdoc/sphinx-latexpdf`.
This is an attempt to make a smaller sphinx/latex docker.

## TODO

At the end of texlive instalation, the following text is printed:

Add /usr/local/texlive/texmf-dist/doc/man to MANPATH.
Add /usr/local/texlive/texmf-dist/doc/info to INFOPATH.
Most importantly, add /usr/local/texlive/bin/x86_64-linux
to your PATH for current and future sessions.
